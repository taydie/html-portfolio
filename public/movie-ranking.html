<h1>The Best Movies According to Taylor</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Green Mile</h3>
<p>A timeless classic that, although a longer-than-average film, keeps you interested and engaged. An interesting story with a cast made for each of their parts. I have loved it dearly since I was a small child.</p>      
<h3>Footloose</h3>
<p>Another classic that is just quite fun to watch, whether watching the original or new version. I am personally a fan of both.</p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>I guess you can call me a sucker for a classic film. A timeless and iconic love story that will outlive us all. Beautifully made.</p>

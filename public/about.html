<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  I am 28 years old, and I am a mother of two. I put a lot of value into my family and strive to better our
  lives every day. I believe in doing the right thing regardless of the circumstances or who may be watching.
  After all, our character is all we have at the end of the day and when the world fades away.

  I graduated high school in May 2013 and completed one year of college before I found myself expecting my
  first child. After that, I stopped attending my local college and shifted my focus to working as much as I
  could in my first couple of part time jobs even though in the end, it was never enough. Although I was young
  and struggled, my baby was the joy and light of my life, and I was enamored with how perfect and easy my
  baby was. It simply was as easy as it possibly could be, which surprised me after how miserable the pregnancy
  actually was. When my first child was about ten months old, I got another surprise just in time for the
  holidays: I was expecting again.

  When I had my second child, I experienced more complications than any new parent would reasonably expect,
  and yet, I knew I was still one of the lucky ones. After nine days in the NICU, we resumed life per usual,
  plus one until we started having our regular checkups with the pediatrician. Then we had what seemed like
  visit after visit with this specialist or that, creating more worry than what reality warranted, such is
  life for any new parent. During this time, I had left my job to be able to better care for my children
  since we were traveling multiple times a week for several months before dropping down to multiple times a
  month. When we finally got the "all clear" from each of our specialists and were finally not bogged down
  by so many appointments (other than the occasional checkup, of course), my second child was about 11 months
  old. I began to find myself itching to get back to work, especially now with two under two.

  After applying everywhere locally and calling time after time to check on applications, I finally received
  a call back about my application to The Home Depot. I felt like I had struck gold after striking out many
  times over the last couple of months. This was going to be my way out, or so it felt at the time. I hit
  the ground running and threw myself completely into being the best associate I could be, always offering
  to work extra hours when and where I could as a part time garden associate. After all, I had two babies to
  provide for. I was promoted to a full time garden position after about four months, which felt like an even
  bigger accomplishment. During my time in my orange apron, I worked in the garden, freight, and hardware
  departments across all shifts (opener, mid, closer, and overnight) and learned as much about other
  areas as possible, even learning and filling in for our bookkeeper a few times. I spent nearly three years
  with the company and still don't regret my time there to this day. It opened more doors for me and saved
  me in more ways than one.

  After leaving The Home Depot, I started working for Mannington as an LTO (lift truck operator) pulling
  material to be shipped out to customers. A few months later, I changed positions to manning our wrapper,
  replacing and reattaching the plastic wrap as needed for pallets getting ready to be loaded. A few months
  after that, I changed positions again, taking on the responsibility of our adhesives area. I worked hard
  for several months cleaning it up and organizing (and reorganizing again and again) the materials to
  make it as efficient as possible for myself and anyone else who might need to pull something for an order
  or for our inventory personnel to have better access to ensure the accuracy of our stock. Finally, I
  applied for an opportunity to change positions again and found myself the newest QA (Quality Assurance)
  Clerk. My job now consisted of checking every order pulled in my area for accuracy and damages among
  other things. Essentially, I was the last stop to make sure our customers were getting exactly what they
  paid for, and I took my job very seriously. I enjoyed the rush of the responsibility and of being good at
  it. I seldom made errors, and even more seldom made errors that weren't caught before leaving our
  warehouse. I was proud of my work and my accuracy and began asking questions and trying to learn even
  more. Yet again, I was offered an opportunity to learn a lead's job to fill in for someone while they
  were to be out for about a month on medical leave. It was challenging, but I learned a lot in that short
  time. While I was filling in for another lead, we had an inventory clerk position become available, and
  I, of course, was interested. I applied and secured my new position in inventory. This was my most
  challenging position. There was so much to learn across various aspects of the job, from being on the
  floor as a pedestrian versus lift trucks to learning how and what to research to learning how to
  navigate more of the complicated SAP system. Although it was difficult, I loved it just as I have always
  enjoyed learning something new and challenging and couldn't get enough the better I got at it. Learning 
  and growing is my favorite pasttime. Fast forward a little over a year, and I am offered a lead position 
  managing inventory in our Dalton facilities, which is also my current position. To say I was proud is an
  understatement. I did not know there would be even more hurdles than I've ever known learning this
  position, and I have been learning it for the last year now, stepping into my fourth year with the company.

  After all of the changes I have experienced over the last several years, I have decided yet again to
  tackle something new that I've had on my mind for years. I have a bit of a creative side but also love
  solving problems and puzzles and helping people. This is why I believe that web development and design
  might be a good fit for me. With this new endeavor, I really hope to accomplish my goals of working from
  home, being able to spend more time with my family, and reaching a level of stability I've never had in
  my life. If there is one thing I want to give my children more than anything in this world, it's the
  stability of having a loving and accepting home that isn't financially broken.
